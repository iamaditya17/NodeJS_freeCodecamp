// sync --> synchronous means Js will read the code synchronously/sequencially

//Disadvantages : if one user is executing a longer task then till the execution is not finished it won't allow other users to do their task.

//But in asynchronous we start the task-1 then we ignore task-1 if it takes more time and directly go to task-2 (no sequencial execution)
